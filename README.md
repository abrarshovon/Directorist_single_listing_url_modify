Go to Snippets > Add New.
Give your snippet a title, e.g., "Custom Directory Listing URL".
Add the code.

Copy and paste the code provided above into the code editor.
Save and activate the snippet.

Click the "Save Changes and Activate" button.
Verify and Flush Rewrite Rules
After adding the snippet, you need to flush the rewrite rules to ensure the new URL structure takes effect:

Go to Settings > Permalinks.
Scroll to the bottom and click "Save Changes".
This will flush the rewrite rules and apply the new URL structure to your directory listings. Now, your listings should have URLs like http://example.com/directory-type/category/location/listing-name/.

The URL structure will appear like this:

Changing here will make effect on the url.
